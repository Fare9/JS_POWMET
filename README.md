Now We will explain the analysis phases:

## Javascript JS_POWMET

First, we checked the xml file with embedded javascript (wscript) code, and we could see that everything was obfuscated on a line with different encodings.
So in a great effort and line by line, we started to study program's logic, and get the functionality of each method.

You can check the obfuscated code in: <a href="https://github.com/Fare9/JS_POWMET/blob/master/JS_POWMET.DE.xml">JS_POWMET.DE.xml</a>

The deobfuscated code in: <a href="https://github.com/Fare9/JS_POWMET/blob/master/JS_POWMET.DE%28desofuscado%29.xml">JS_POWMET.DE(deobfuscated).xml</a>

And the Strings: <a href="https://github.com/Fare9/JS_POWMET/blob/master/CadenasCodificadasDescodificadas">Strings</a>
